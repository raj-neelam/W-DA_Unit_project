            <h2>History of www</h2>
            <p class="buff">
                The World Wide Web (WWW) was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN, a research organization in Switzerland. He developed it as a way for scientists to easily share information across different computers. The first website went live in 1991, providing basic information about the WWW. Since then, the WWW has grown into a vast network of interconnected webpages, serving as a hub for communication, research, entertainment, and much more. Its development has revolutionized how we access and share information globally.

            <h2>Evolution of HTML</h2>
            <p class="buff">
                <div class="ital">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s. Here's a brief overview of its evolution:</div>
                <ol class="buff">
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 1.0 (1991)</b>: This was the first version of HTML, primarily focused on structuring text documents with basic elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It introduced the concept of hyperlinks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 2.0 (1995)</b>: This version added features like tables, forms, and image support. It also introduced the &lt;meta&gt; tag for specifying metadata about the document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 3.2 (1997)</b>: This version standardized many features that were previously only supported by certain browsers. It introduced support for frames, scripting, and improved table capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML 4.01 (1999)</b>: HTML 4.01 refined and extended the features introduced in previous versions. It added support for style sheets (CSS), scripting with JavaScript, and introduced more semantic elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>XHTML (2000)</b>: XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML syntax. It aimed to make HTML more compatible with XML and to enforce stricter syntax rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML5 (2014)</b>: HTML5 brought significant changes and improvements to HTML. It introduced new semantic elements (e.g., &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;), native support for multimedia elements (audio, video), canvas for graphics, and support for offline web applications. It also included APIs for geolocation, drag and drop, and web storage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>HTML Living Standard (Ongoing)</b>: Instead of releasing new versions, HTML is now maintained as a "living standard," continuously evolving with new features and improvements. Browser vendors implement features as they become standardized, leading to a more dynamic development process.HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands of modern web development, with ongoing efforts to improve accessibility, performance, and flexibility.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>   
            <h2>Different HTML versions</h2>
            <p class="buff">
                <ol class="buff">
                    <li>HTML 1.0 (1991)</li>
                    <li>HTML 2.0 (1995)</li>
                    <li>HTML 3.2 (1997)</li>
                    <li>HTML 4.01 (1999)</li>

                    <li>HTML5 (2014)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>Why HTML5?</h2>
            <p class="buff">
                <div class="ital">HTML5 was introduced to address several shortcomings and to meet the growing demands of web development. Here are some reasons why HTML5 was developed:</div>
                <ul class="buff">
                    <li>
                        <b>Richer Multimedia Support</b>: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This made it easier for developers to incorporate multimedia content into web pages while improving performance and accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Improved Semantics</b>: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;article&gt;, making it easier to structure web pages in a more meaningful way. This not only improves accessibility for assistive technologies but also helps search engines better understand and index web content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Enhanced Interactivity</b>: HTML5 brought new features like the &lt;canvas&gt; element for drawing graphics dynamically using JavaScript, and the &lt;input&gt; element with various types for handling user input more efficiently. These enhancements allowed developers to create more interactive and engaging web applications without relying heavily on plugins or external frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Offline Web Applications</b>: HTML5 introduced features like the Application Cache and Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage), allowing web applications to work offline and store data locally. This was a significant improvement for users who may not always have a reliable internet connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mobile Optimization</b>: HTML5 includes features designed to improve the mobile browsing experience, such as support for touch events and device orientation detection. This made it easier for developers to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites and applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cross-platform Compatibility<b>: HTML5 was developed with the goal of being supported consistently across different devices and browsers. This reduces the need for browser-specific workarounds and ensures a more consistent experience for users regardless of the platform they are using.
                    </li>
                </ul>
